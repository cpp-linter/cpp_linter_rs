Command Line Interface Options
==============================

.. std:option:: -v, --verbosity

    This controls the action's verbosity in the workflow's logs.
    Supported options are defined by the `logging-level <logging-levels>`_.
    This option does not affect the verbosity of resulting
    thread comments or file annotations.
    

    :Default:
        ``"info"``
.. std:option:: -p, --database

    The path that is used to read a compile command database.
    For example, it can be a CMake build directory in which a file named
    compile_commands.json exists (set ``CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`` to ``ON``).
    When no build path is specified, a search for compile_commands.json will be
    attempted through all parent paths of the first input file. See
    https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.html for an
    example of setting up Clang Tooling on a source tree.

.. std:option:: -s, --style

    The style rules to use.
    
    - Set this to ``file`` to have clang-format use the closest relative
      .clang-format file.
    - Set this to a blank string (``''``) to disable using clang-format
      entirely.
    

    :Default:
        ``"llvm"``
.. std:option:: -c, --tidy-checks

    A comma-separated list of globs with optional ``-`` prefix.
    Globs are processed in order of appearance in the list.
    Globs without ``-`` prefix add checks with matching names to the set,
    globs with the ``-`` prefix remove checks with matching names from the set of
    enabled checks. This option's value is appended to the value of the 'Checks'
    option in a .clang-tidy file (if any).
    
    - It is possible to disable clang-tidy entirely by setting this option to
      ``'-*'``.
    - It is also possible to rely solely on a .clang-tidy config file by
      specifying this option as a blank string (``''``).
    
    See also clang-tidy docs for more info.
    

    :Default:
        ``"boost-*,bugprone-*,performance-*,readability-*,portability-*,modernize-*,clang-analyzer-*,cppcoreguidelines-*"``
.. std:option:: -V, --version

    The desired version of the clang tools to use. Accepted options are
    strings which can be 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
    
    - Set this option to a blank string (``''``) to use the
      platform's default installed version.
    - This value can also be a path to where the clang tools are
      installed (if using a custom install location). All paths specified
      here are converted to absolute.
    

    :Default:
        ``""``
.. std:option:: -e, --extensions

    A comma-separated list of file extensions to analyze.
    

    :Default:
        ``"c,h,C,H,cpp,hpp,cc,hh,c++,h++,cxx,hxx"``
.. std:option:: -r, --repo-root

    The relative path to the repository root directory. This path is
    relative to the runner's ``GITHUB_WORKSPACE`` environment variable (or
    the current working directory if not using a CI runner).
    

    :Default:
        ``"."``
.. std:option:: -i, --ignore

    Set this option with path(s) to ignore (or not ignore).
    
    - In the case of multiple paths, you can use `|` to separate each path.
    - There is no need to use ``./`` for each entry; a blank string (``''``)
      represents the repo-root path.
    - This can also have files, but the file's path (relative to
      the :std:option:`--repo-root`) has to be specified with the filename.
    - Submodules are automatically ignored. Hidden directories (beginning
      with a ``.``) are also ignored automatically.
    - Prefix a path with ``!`` to explicitly not ignore it. This can be
      applied to a submodule's path (if desired) but not hidden directories.
    - Glob patterns are not supported here. All asterisk characters (``*``)
      are literal.
    

    :Default:
        ``".github|target"``
.. std:option:: -l, --lines-changed-only

    This controls what part of the files are analyzed.
    The following values are accepted:
    
    - ``false``: All lines in a file are analyzed.
    - ``true``: Only lines in the diff that contain additions are analyzed.
    - ``diff``: All lines in the diff are analyzed (including unchanged
      lines but not subtractions).
    

    :Default:
        ``"true"``
.. std:option:: -f, --files-changed-only

    Set this option to false to analyze any source files in the repo.
    This is automatically enabled if
    :std:option:`--lines-changed-only` is enabled.
    
    .. note::
        The ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` should be supplied when running on a
        private repository with this option enabled, otherwise the runner
        does not not have the privilege to list the changed files for an event.
    
        See `Authenticating with the GITHUB_TOKEN
        <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow>`_
    

    :Default:
        ``"false"``
.. std:option:: -x, --extra-arg

    A string of extra arguments passed to clang-tidy for use as
    compiler arguments. This can be specified more than once for each
    additional argument. Recommend using quotes around the value and
    avoid using spaces between name and value (use ``=`` instead):
    
    .. code-block:: shell
    
        cpp-linter --extra-arg="-std=c++17" --extra-arg="-Wall"

.. std:option:: -g, --thread-comments

    Set this option to true to enable the use of thread comments as feedback.
    Set this to ``update`` to update an existing comment if one exists;
    the value 'true' will always delete an old comment and post a new one if necessary.
    
    .. note::
        To use thread comments, the ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` (provided by
        Github to each repository) must be declared as an environment
        variable.
    
        See `Authenticating with the GITHUB_TOKEN
        <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow>`_
    
    .. hint::
        If run on a private repository, then this feature is
        disabled because the GitHub REST API behaves
        differently for thread comments on a private repository.
    

    :Default:
        ``"false"``
.. std:option:: -t, --no-lgtm

    Set this option to true or false to enable or disable the use of a
    thread comment that basically says 'Looks Good To Me' (when all checks pass).
    
    .. seealso::
        The :std:option:`--thread-comments` option also notes further implications.
    

    :Default:
        ``"true"``
.. std:option:: -w, --step-summary

    Set this option to true or false to enable or disable the use of
    a workflow step summary when the run has concluded.
    

    :Default:
        ``"false"``
.. std:option:: -a, --file-annotations

    Set this option to false to disable the use of
    file annotations as feedback.
    

    :Default:
        ``"true"``
